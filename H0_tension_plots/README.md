# H<sub>0</sub> tension
-- A fancy way to represent the tension between Hubble constant measurements as in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019NatAs...3..891V/abstract">Verde et al. 2019</a>--

### This is amazing, can I use it?
Yes sure, but please cite our <a href="http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3635517"> Zenodo entry </a>. You can always reach us via the issue system if you would like an updated/modified version for your needs.

If you use this plot, do not forget to also properly cite each of the individual measurements : 

 * <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv180706209P/abstract"> Planck 2018 results </a>, using CMB observation from Planck
 * <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.480.3879A/abstract"> DES Year 1 results</a>, using clustering and weak lensing in combination with BAO and BBN. 
 * <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200204035P/abstract"> Philcox et al. (2020)</a>, using Full-Shape and BA0 analyses in the BOSS survey in combination with BBN.
 * <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...876...85R/abstract">  SHOES</a>, using the distance ladder method with SNe Ia and Cepheids. 
 * <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...882...34F/abstract"> CCHP</a>, using the distance ladder method with SNe Ia and the Tip of the Red Giand Branch. 
 * <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...876...85R/abstract"> MIRAS</a>, using the distance ladder method with SNIe Ia and Mira variables 
 * <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190704869W/abstract"> H0LiCOW 6-lenses results</a>, using time-delay cosmography in lensed quasars
 * <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...891L...1P/abstract"> MCP</a>, using water megamasers
 * <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AAS...23231902P/abstract"> SBF</a>, using Surface Brightness Fluctuation and Cepheids
 
The code is not very well documented yet, but is simple enough so that it shouldn't take long to anyone with decent python skills to understand how it works. 

#### Are you planning to update this plot when new measurements come out?
We sure do. Let us know if we missed a new result!
